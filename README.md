# Image-Classification-Deep-Learning

## MNIST dataset- 
Built a convolutional neural network for the MNIST dataset consisting of greyscale handwritten digits. While taking one of these images and predicting the digit in the image using PyTorch.We have used Softmax as the loss function and Adam optimizer.
We have achieved an accuracy of over 98% and saved this model which can be used as a digit-classifier.

## CIFAR-10 dataset- 
Build a CNN for image classification of the CIFAR-10 dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, which predict the class of these images using PyTorch. The model consists of a sequence of 3 convolution, max-pooling layers and 2 hidden layers with ReLU activation function.

## Malaria Cell Image Classification-
The dataset consists of two types of images - Infected and Uninfected. A total of 27,558 images. Classify the cell images taken from microscope to be infected or infected.
